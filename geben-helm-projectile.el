;;; Commentary:

;; helm-projectile integration for geben (in particular, opening files)

;; Make sure to include the project, then just run geben-helm-projectile/file
;; during an interactive geben session to open a file related to the project.

;;; News:

;;;; Changes since 0.0.1:
;; - Disable require statement for geben due to issue in it's defadvice

;;;; Changes since 0.0.0:
;; - Created the project

;; Commenting out at the moment, requiring geben causes a defadvice to trigger
;; within the geben package, that breaks network functionality in much of
;; the open-network-stream commands, with an error such as:
;; `ad-Advice-open-network-stream: Wrong type argument: processp, nil'
;; Will add again when issue is fixed in geben

;;(eval-and-compile
;;  (require 'geben)
;;  (require 'helm-projectile))
